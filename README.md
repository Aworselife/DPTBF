# DUAL-PATH TRANSFORMER BASED NEURAL BEAMFORMER FOR TARGET SPEECH EXTRACTION
A neural beamformer modeled by a dual-path transformer, bypassing the pre-separation module and intermediate variable estimation.
Shown here are some audio samples from the test set processed by the model.
The source code of the model is also provided for understanding the dimension transformation and reproducing the experiment.
